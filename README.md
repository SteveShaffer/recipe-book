# Recipe Book - An app for storing your recipe cards

I'm writing this as a fun app to build for my wife to store all her recipe
cards electronically.  I'm also using it as a way to learn the "proper" way
to do a GAE-backed AngularJS app (because getting paid to do such does not
always generate "proper" code).

Soon I'll be writing tests (Angular unit, Angular e2e, and Python unit) as I
learn how to actually do that.

Well feel free to fork I suppose.  No official method right now.

## License

I really don't know how this works yet.  So eventually I'll probably put some
 license up here, but for now I guess this is considered what "no-license"
 projects are considered (closed source?).
